What does Rhodes Statue look,"The text describes the Colossus of Rhodes as being incredibly large and imposing:

* **Height:** It stood at about 70 cubits (which is roughly 32 meters or 105 feet), a significant height that dwarfed many other structures. 
* **Structure:** It was likely made from marble and bronze, with iron and bronze reforged from weapons left behind by Demetrius' army. The statue had some scaffolding around the lower levels during construction.

The Colossus' size and stature were remarkable enough to leave a lasting impression:  Pliny the Elder described it as inspiring wonder and admiration even after being damaged in an earthquake.
